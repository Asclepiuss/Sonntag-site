            <h2> To Tend To The Flame. </h2>
            <p>Every good story behaves like a bonfire. Blades of golden warmth flicker at the eyes of the beholder, vying for their attention, to pull at the strings of their conscious and their heart. It serves to warm the cold and to calm the weary, to usher adventure and to warn of its dangers, to break the ice and forge the iron with which a universe is made. If it burns bright enough, its warmth still lingers and allures long after its fire has extinguished, fueled by those who felt it once, and forever longed for it. </p>
            <p>He who keeps the flame, gives it fuel for it to rise and air for it to breathe, does so out of their soul and blood. We remember the ones whose bonfires burned bright enough to scorch the world, or to tear it asunder end to end. We remember the ones who gave their blood to fuel the flame to the last drop. The test to every stoker eventually comes when their flame does not only become theirs, but also from the people who shelter close for its warmth, as they contribute fuel for it to rise, and air for it to breathe.</p>
            <p>If escape is every writer's guide word, let them pick up the torch, and forge ahead into the darkness. </p>
            
            <h2> To Worship The Ashes. </h2>
            <p>Unfortunately for both the reader and the writer of this here reference document, this is not a burning pyre nor a raging inferno, but yet to be embers, gathered fuel, and ashes from fires past. A listing of all characters-to-be that directly reference this one keystone of my writing. A personality profile that mirrors me as a person just enough for me to act them properly, but far away enough so that I am not cripplingly invested emotionally. These are the coals that power my forge, and the embers that fuel my passion for the keys and the pen.</p>
