# Sonntag

Hello, and welcome to Sonntag. This is my portifolio website. The place i designed to host all nice things about myself and my creative work. That i'm ready to show, anyways.

It's built with:
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript / TypeScript (coming soon)  
- PHP (future backend integration)

It features:
- A drop-down navigation bar
- Scalable folder structur
- And a future plan to make it into a webapp and mobile app for the fun of it.

My roadmap includes: 

- [ ] Responsive layout
- [ ] Dropdown navigation
- [ ] Theme system with CSS variables
- [ ] JavaScript interactivity
- [ ] PHP templates
